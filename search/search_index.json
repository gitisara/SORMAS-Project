Table of Contents Submitting an Issue Bug Report Change Request Feature Request Support Request Contributing to the Project Contributing to the Code Development Contributing Guidelines Picking Issues for Development Submitting Pull Requests Submitting an Issue Before creating a new issue, please search the repository for similar issues first to avoid duplicates! You can do this by using the search field in the menu bar. If you find an issue that already covers your request or seems very similar, please comment on that issue. Please make sure to always use one of the templates that are automatically presented to you when creating a new issue because it ensures that your issue is structured and ideally contains all the information that we need. Please add information to every mandatory section of the issue templates, and try to fill in the optional sections if possible. Please note that we might have to close issues that are not created this way. If you want to report a security issue , please follow our guidelines for Responsible Disclosure . Bug Report Bug reports cover everything that leads to the application behaving in an unintended way, including crashes, unexpected error messages, data loss, etc. If something seems to be working correctly but does not necessarily match your expectations of how it should be working, please consider opening a change request instead. Bug Description: A description of what exactly happened, where it happened and under which circumstances. Provide as many details as possible, even if they might seem irrelevant to you. Steps to Reproduce: If possible, provide a step-by-step instruction on the order of actions you performed before the bug occurred. This helps us to reproduce it on our system. Generally optional , but likely necessary for more complex bugs. Expected Behavior: Quickly describe what you believe should have happened instead of the error you got. Optional when the error is identified by a crash or an error message, but likely necessary if the bug is the result of a misbehavior of the application. Screenshots: If possible, make at least one screenshot of the bug and include it in your bug report. You can do this by simply dragging-and-dropping the image file into the template you're filling out. Optional , but very helpful for us. System Details: Tell us which device you were using, on which SORMAS version the error occurred and, depending on whether you were using the mobile app or the web app, your Android version or web browser. Additional Information: If there is anything else you want to add to your request, you can put it here. Optional . Change Request Change requests cover features that are already part of SORMAS. This primarily includes aspects (or whole features) for which you would like to request an altered behavior, but also small extensions (e.g. additional values being added to a dropdown field). Feature Description: Please describe the feature you would like us to change like it is in SORMAS right now. If it is about a relatively big or a very general feature, namig it briefly might be enough. If it is about a very specific detail of said feature, please try to be more specific. Problem Description: Tell us why you want us to change the feature and what you believe is wrong or could be improved about the way it is currently designed. Proposed Change: Describe in as much detail as possible how you would like us to change the feature and what the expected outcome of your request should look like. Possible Alternatives: If possible, provide alternative solutions in case your proposed change can not be implemented for any reason. This is generally optional but might be requested at a later point in time. Additional Information: If there is anything else you want to add to your request, you can put it here. Optional . Feature Request These types of issue cover everything that involves adding new features to SORMAS. This includes both very large additions like completely new app sections, but also smaller ones like adding a new field to an existing form. Situation Description: Please describe why your proposed feature is required, why SORMAS in its current state is not able to do what you want it to do, and in which way it would benefit from your feature being implemented. Feature Description: Describe in as much detail as possible how your proposed feature should look like and what it should do. Possible Alternatives: If possible, provide alternative solutions in case your proposed feature can not be implemented in the way you outlined it for any reason. This is generally optional but might be requested at a later point in time. Additional Information: If there is anything else you want to add to your request, you can put it here. Optional . Support Request If you have problems setting up a SORMAS server or your development environment, don't know how a specific functionality in SORMAS is supposed to work, or have any other request that is not directly associated with a bug report, change or feature request, a support request is likely the correct type of issue for your concern. Alternatively, you can join our Gitter channel and ask your question over there which might potentially give you a quicker and more comfortable way to talk about your request. If your request is about a specific problem, please make sure to provide as much information as possible. Contributing to the Project There are a lot of ways in which you can contribute to this project as a non-developer. If there is something you would like to do that you don't find instructions about here - or if you want to learn how you can get involved - please contact us at sormas@helmholtz-hzi.de and let us know how we can assist you! Some possibilities to contribute to SORMAS are: * Helping with translation * Defining new diseases Contributing to the Code If you're interested in participating in the development of SORMAS, please follow the Development Environment Setup Instructions before you start developing. If you have problems setting up your development environment or need assistance in choosing the first issue to work on, please get in touch with us by joining our Gitter channel or contacting us at sormas@helmholtz-hzi.de. Additionally, our Wiki contains some specific development guides that cover common issues like adding new fields to an entity that we suggest to check out before you start implementing something related to those topics. Development Contributing Guidelines In addition to the guidelines covered in the Development Environment Setup Instructions, please ensure to adhere to the following principles and procedures while developing code for SORMAS: Remember to always apply code formatting and import reordering for all classes you work on; we recommend to use the Save Actions plugin as described in the setup instructions instead of manually executing these steps. Some code formatting rules can't be enforced by the code formatter. Please make sure to write your code in accordance to the following rules: When defining a method, enter a blank line before starting to write its body (except for methods with only one line of code, e.g. most getters and setters). Use a blank line to separate logical blocks of code within a method. Apart from those, don't use blank lines where they are not necessarily needed to keep the code compact and readable. Don't use blank lines after the last statement of a block, but a closing } with proper indentation in the next line instead. Don't use blank lines between two closing } . You can use //@formatter:off and //@formatter:on to encapsulate code blocks that you don't want automatic code formatting to be applied to, e.g. because it would mess up readability. Please only use this if really needed and try to use proper indentation nonetheless. Separate code and comments, i.e. write the comment in a separate line before the statement that you want to explain. When you create new classes, please add license headers to them according to the Adding License Headers guide Commit messages have to be related to a specific issue on GitHub and reference its issue number as well as include a short description on what has been done in the commit. We might reject pull requests that violate this principle and ask you to re-submit it with proper commit messages. An acceptable commit message could look like this: 61 - added model to define classification, apply automatic case classification whenever a field value changes Picking Issues for Development When picking tasks for development, you can either search the repository for existing issues that you would like to work on, or you can submit your own issues if you don't find any that cover your topic of interest (see the \"Submitting an Issue\" section of this guide). While it is not mandatory, we heavily suggest to mark issues that you want to work on with the approval requested label and wait for one of the core developers to respond to the issue in one of the following ways. If you didn't create the issue yourself but picked an existing one, please also add a comment to indicate that you would like to work on it. The developer might request clarification concerning the specifications of the issue; please try to to answer their questions or extend the issue description and wait for their feedback. The developer might suggest changes to the functional or technical specifications to ensure that it fits the overall vision of the application; please confirm these suggestions or discuss them with the developer if you don't agree with them. The developer might approve the issue by adding an approval comment and removing the approval requested label. This means that we believe that the specifications are complete and the purpose of the issue serves the overall vision of SORMAS. At this point you can start development on the issue. The developer might ask you to pick another issue for development. This will usually only happen if the issue you have requested approval for is already planned to be developed by the core development team for the current or next milestone. The developer might reject the issue altogether. This will usually only happen if it doesn't fit the overall vision of the application at all or is a duplicate, and most of the time we will discuss this with you before closing the issue. The advantage of adhering to this process is that you can be sure that there won't be any major change requests in terms of functional or technical specifications once you've submitted a pull request containing your work, and that discussions concerning these topics can be led and finished before starting development. If you have labeled an issue with approval requested but don't receive any feedback on it for a few days, please add a comment that directly tags @MateStrysewske , @MartinWahnschaffe or @markusmann-vg . Submitting Pull Requests Contributing to the SORMAS code requires you to submit pull requests that will be reviewed by one of our core developers. Once a pull request has been submitted to our repository, a developer will either assign themselves as its reviewer or we will get back to you in case we won't be able to review it in time. This may e.g. happen if your pull request involves a lot of technical changes that we would like to merge together with other issues of the same nature or that could potentially break a lot of logic. Usually though, the general process looks like this: A developer assigns themselves as the reviewer of your pull request. Please wait until the review is done; if you think that the review is taking too long, feel free to add a comment to the pull request as a reminder to the developer. The developer might request changes to the code. If that's the case, please implement the requested changes or answer to their change request if you have questions or don't agree with a specific part of the request. Once you've implemented all requested changes, please request another review by the assigned developer by clicking on the \"Re-request review\" icon next to their name. As soon as the developer is happy with the submitted code (which might require multiple iterations of step 2 and 3, especially for larger pull requests), they will merge it into the development branch and close the pull request. Please adhere to the following principles when submitting pull requests: Only submit pull requests that are directly associated with ideally one specific issue in our GitHub repository. If there is no issue for the development work that you would like to do, create one before you start working on it. Link your pull request to the issue(s) that they are associated with. This can be done either by using the \"Linked issues\" section at the right side when viewing a pull request, or by adding the keyword \"Closes\" or \"Fixes\" followed by the issue number to the pull request description (e.g. \"Closes #61\"). Make sure that your pull request has a meaningful title. By default, GitHub will use your commit message as the title which might not be appropriate. In general, using the same name as the linked issue is a good rule of thumb. Try to not use force-push when updating an existing pull request (e.g. after changes have been requested or because you need to resolve merge conflicts). Ideally, your pull request should pass the checks done by the automatic CI pipeline before it gets reviewed. If that's not the case, please make sure that your branch is up-to-date with the current development branch. If the checks also fail for the development branch, you're not required to do anything. In any other case, please fix the issues (most likely failed unit tests) before requesting another review.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#contributing-guidelines","text":"If you want to contribute to SORMAS by any means - for example by submitting a bug report, requesting a new feature, translating the application into a new language, or actively contributing to the source code -, please make sure to read through and follow these guidelines.

Some code formatting rules can't be enforced by the code formatter. Please make sure to write your code in accordance to the following rules: When defining a method, enter a blank line before starting to write its body (except for methods with only one line of code, e.g. most getters and setters). Use a blank line to separate logical blocks of code within a method. Apart from those, don't use blank lines where they are not necessarily needed to keep the code compact and readable. Don't use blank lines after the last statement of a block, but a closing } with proper indentation in the next line instead. Don't use blank lines between two closing } . You can use //@formatter:off and //@formatter:on to encapsulate code blocks that you don't want automatic code formatting to be applied to, e.g. because it would mess up readability. Please only use this if really needed and try to use proper indentation nonetheless. Separate code and comments, i.e. write the comment in a separate line before the statement that you want to explain. When you create new classes, please add license headers to them according to the Adding License Headers guide Commit messages have to be related to a specific issue on GitHub and reference its issue number as well as include a short description on what has been done in the commit. We might reject pull requests that violate this principle and ask you to re-submit it with proper commit messages. An acceptable commit message could look like this:","title":"Development Contributing Guidelines"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#61-added-model-to-define-classification-apply-automatic-case-classification-whenever-a-field-value-changes","text":"","title":"61 - added model to define classification, apply automatic case classification whenever a field value changes"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#picking-issues-for-development","text":"When picking tasks for development, you can either search the repository for existing issues that you would like to work on, or you can submit your own issues if you don't find any that cover your topic of interest (see the \"Submitting an Issue\" section of this guide). While it is not mandatory, we heavily suggest to mark issues that you want to work on with the approval requested label and wait for one of the core developers to respond to the issue in one of the following ways. If you didn't create the issue yourself but picked an existing one, please also add a comment to indicate that you would like to work on it. The developer might request clarification concerning the specifications of the issue; please try to to answer their questions or extend the issue description and wait for their feedback. The developer might suggest changes to the functional or technical specifications to ensure that it fits the overall vision of the application; please confirm these suggestions or discuss them with the developer if you don't agree with them. The developer might approve the issue by adding an approval comment and removing the approval requested label. This means that we believe that the specifications are complete and the purpose of the issue serves the overall vision of SORMAS. At this point you can start development on the issue. The developer might ask you to pick another issue for development. This will usually only happen if the issue you have requested approval for is already planned to be developed by the core development team for the current or next milestone. The developer might reject the issue altogether. This will usually only happen if it doesn't fit the overall vision of the application at all or is a duplicate, and most of the time we will discuss this with you before closing the issue. The advantage of adhering to this process is that you can be sure that there won't be any major change requests in terms of functional or technical specifications once you've submitted a pull request containing your work, and that discussions concerning these topics can be led and finished before starting development. If you have labeled an issue with approval requested but don't receive any feedback on it for a few days, please add a comment that directly tags @MateStrysewske , @MartinWahnschaffe or @markusmann-vg .","title":"Picking Issues for Development"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#submitting-pull-requests","text":"Contributing to the SORMAS code requires you to submit pull requests that will be reviewed by one of our core developers. Once a pull request has been submitted to our repository, a developer will either assign themselves as its reviewer or we will get back to you in case we won't be able to review it in time. This may e.g. happen if your pull request involves a lot of technical changes that we would like to merge together with other issues of the same nature or that could potentially break a lot of logic. Usually though, the general process looks like this: A developer assigns themselves as the reviewer of your pull request. Please wait until the review is done; if you think that the review is taking too long, feel free to add a comment to the pull request as a reminder to the developer. The developer might request changes to the code. If that's the case, please implement the requested changes or answer to their change request if you have questions or don't agree with a specific part of the request. Once you've implemented all requested changes, please request another review by the assigned developer by clicking on the \"Re-request review\" icon next to their name. As soon as the developer is happy with the submitted code (which might require multiple iterations of step 2 and 3, especially for larger pull requests), they will merge it into the development branch and close the pull request. Please adhere to the following principles when submitting pull requests: Only submit pull requests that are directly associated with ideally one specific issue in our GitHub repository. If there is no issue for the development work that you would like to do, create one before you start working on it. Link your pull request to the issue(s) that they are associated with. This can be done either by using the \"Linked issues\" section at the right side when viewing a pull request, or by adding the keyword \"Closes\" or \"Fixes\" followed by the issue number to the pull request description (e.g. \"Closes #61\"). Make sure that your pull request has a meaningful title. By default, GitHub will use your commit message as the title which might not be appropriate. In general, using the same name as the linked issue is a good rule of thumb. Try to not use force-push when updating an existing pull request (e.g. after changes have been requested or because you need to resolve merge conflicts). Ideally, your pull request should pass the checks done by the automatic CI pipeline before it gets reviewed. If that's not the case, please make sure that your branch is up-to-date with the current development branch. If the checks also fail for the development branch, you're not required to do anything. In any other case, please fix the issues (most likely failed unit tests) before requesting another review.","title":"Submitting Pull Requests"},{"location":"DEMO_APP/","text":"Creating a demo app for a SORMAS demo server Important : This only applies if you have setup your own SORMAS server for demo purposes and and want to give users easy access to it.

The translation of SORMAS relies on people from the community. If you would like to see SORMAS translated to your language, please read the points below and take part in the process. How is SORMAS translated? The official SORMAS translation is done using the Crowdin platform: https://crowdin.com/project/sormas All translations done on the platform are automatically fed into SORMAS and are part of the bi-weekly release schedule. This means that any text you translate will likely be part of the next SORMAS release. Once your server (or the server of your country) is updated you will be able to see the translations in the web app and mobile app. How to participate in translating SORMAS You can join the translation project by creating a free account on Crowdin. You can also use your existing GitHub account. Before starting to translate, you need to request write access to the project. A member of the project will either accept your request or get in touch with you as soon as possible. Afterwards open the SORMAS project https://crowdin.com/project/sormas and select the language you would like to translate.

This is done in the sormas.properties file that you can find in your domain folder. This file contains explanations for every property and also a default value in case you want to revert any changes that you've made. Most of these properties are commented (indicated by a # in front of their name and value) because the default should work for most servers. If you want to change these properties, you can remove the # and specify a valid value. We strongly suggest to add values to the properties that are not commented by default because these are specific to your server (e.g. the default locale/language, the center of the country or region you're using SORMAS in and the URL that leads to the mobile .apk file). Please note that this file contains all the properties that existed in the SORMAS version that you initially installed on your server. We strongly suggest to read the release notes of new versions in order to keep yourself updated about new properties or whether the expected values of existing ones have changed. In any of these cases, you need to manually update the properties file and either insert the new property or change the existing value to one that is compatible. The release notes will give you instructions on how to do this. The following properties are currently configurable: Default locale country.locale : This is the locale your server is using as long as the user has not overwritten it in their settings. It impacts both the language that SORMAS is displayed in as well as e.g. date formats. EPID prefix country.epidprefix : SORMAS automatically generates EPID numbers for new cases. This is the prefix your country is using for all of these numbers. Most of the time it will be some sort of country code and should be three characters long. Country name country.name : Name of the country to pre-fill the country fields for locations and to activate the region, district, etc. fields when this country is selected. Needs to match the name of the country in the database. Country center/zoom country.center.latitude , country.center.longitude and map.zoom : These are the geo coordinates of the geographical center of the country or region you're using SORMAS in. Used to set the initial location of the maps used in dashboards and statistics. App URL app.url : The directory on your server where the mobile .apk file is stored that is used to automatically update the Android app after a new release. You should be able to copy the example given in the properties file and only have to replace the SERVER-NAME placeholder. File paths documents.path , temp.path , generated.path and custom.path : The folders that SORMAS stores files in, either temporarily during case export or permanently like import templates or documents. Files in temp.path are automatically deleted at midnight. Files in custom.path can be used to customize the login page, e.g. to provide default logins for demo servers or add additional contributors to the right sidebar. Automatic case classification feature.automaticcaseclassification : Determines whether SORMAS automatically classifies cases based on a number of criteria that are defined in the code. Email settings email.sender.address and email.sender.name : The email address and sender name that should be used when SORMAS is sending out emails, e.g. to notify users about specific events. SMS settings sms.sender.name, sms.auth.key and sms.auth.secret : Besides emails, SORMAS also supports sending automatic SMS to users at the same time (e.g. when a case has been classified as confirmed). The SMS provider SORMAS is using is the Vonage SMS API ( https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/sms/ ). If you have an account there, you can use your key and secret here to enable sending out SMS. Leaving these properties empty will disable this feature. CSV separator csv.separator : The separator that CSV files should use to separate columns. This is depending on your server locale. Most systems should be fine using the default ( , ), but e.g. German systems should be set to use ; . Name similarity threshold namesimilaritythreshold : This is used when comparing cases or contacts to find duplicates in the system, either in retrospection or during creation or import. The higher the value, the more restrictive the algorithm, i.e. less potential duplicates will be found. It is suggested to play around with this setting to see which value works for your country and language. Dev mode devmode : Enabling developer mode will give you access to a tab in the Configuration menu that allows admins to create dummy cases and contacts to quickly fill the database. This is only meant to be used on development or demo systems and should be left disabled for production servers. Infrastructure sync threshold infrastructuresyncthreshold : Synchronizing infrastructure data to mobile apps (e.g. regions or health facilities) is done in chunks to avoid connection timeouts. If you expect your users to have very bad internet connection, lowering this threshold could make it easier for them to synchronize this data. Archiving thresholds daysAfterCaseGetsArchived and daysAfterEventGetsArchived : The number of days without any changes after which cases/events are automatically archived (i.e. they will no longer be displayed in the normal directories, but still count towards statistics or counts on the dashboard and can still be viewed by users with the respective user right). If set to 0, automatic archiving is disabled. Rscript executable rscript.executable : The location of the Rscript executable. If you've installed Rscript on your server and specify the path here (the default should work for Linux systems as long as you've used the default install path), network diagrams for transmission chains will be shown in the web app. Symptom journal interface : Properties used to connect to an external symptom journal service. interface.symptomjournal.url is the URL to the website that SORMAS should connect to; interface.symptomjournal.authurl is the URL used to authenticate SORMAS at the external service; interface.symptomjournal.clientid and interface.symptomjournal.secret are the credentials used for the authentication process. A default user can be created automatically at startup by using interface.symptomjournal.defaultuser.username and interface.symptomjournal.defaultuser.password . This user can be used by the Symptom Journal system to connect to SORMAS. Patient diary interface Properties used to connect to an external patient diary service. interface.patientdiary.url is the URL to the website that SORMAS should connect to; interface.patientdiary.probandsurl is the URL to the website that SORMAS can send notifications; interface.patientdiary.authurl is the URL trough which SORMAS can obtain an authorization to the external patient diary; interface.patientdiary.email and interface.patientdiary.password are the credentials used by SORMAS to authenticate in the external patient diary. A default user can be created automatically at startup by using interface.patientdiary.defaultuser.username and interface.patientdiary.defaultuser.password . This user can be used by the Patient Diary system to connect to SORMAS. Custom branding : Properties used to apply a custom branding to SORMAS that overrides its name and default logo. Using these properties also alters the sidebar and adds another customizable area to it. If you want to use this feature, set custombranding to true. custombranding.name is the name that you want to use, custombranding.logo.path is the path to the logo that should be used. Geocoding Properties used to integrate an external geocoding service for obtaining the geo coordinates of addresses. geocodingServiceUrlTemplate is the url for searching for address details, ${street} , ${houseNumber} , ${postalCode} , and ${city} placeholders will be replaced with the actual address fields when searching; geocodingLongitudeJsonPath and geocodingLatitudeJsonPath are used to obtain the longitude and latitude of the address in the result of the geocoding service request Authentication Provider : Allows the user to choose the way of authentication for SORMAS and all it's third party clients. Supported values SORMAS (default) and KEYCLOAK Authentication Provider User Sync At Startup : Enables async user sync when the system boots up. Since the User Sync is mainly needed for an initial sync only, it's recommended to disable/remove this property once an initial sync has be performed. The User Sync will work similarly to the manual user sync: creates all the missing users in the External Authentication Provider updates all existing users in the External Authentication Provider keeps the user's password if the user doesn't exist in the External Authentication Provider will not override the user's password if the user already in the External Authentication Provider (matching done by username case insensitive) will only sync active users (inactive users are automatically synchronized when they are activated manually) is enabled trough a property in sormas.properties authentication.provider.userSyncAtStartup (by default is disabled) Custom login page When setting up the server a custom file directory is created (most likely /opt/sormas/custom ). You can adjust the login*.html files in that directory to customize the login page. Custom download files in about section You can create a sub-folder aboutfiles in the custom directory mentioned above (e.g. /opt/sormas/custom/aboutfiles ). Any file in that directory will be made available in the about section of the frontend. Importing Infrastructure Data When you start a SORMAS server for the first time, some default infrastructure data is generated to ensure that the server is usable and the default users can be created. It is recommended (and, unless you're working on a demo server, necessary) to archive this default data and import the official infrastructure data of the country or part of the country that you intend to use SORMAS in instead. Import SORMAS by default splits infrastructure data into four categories. Starting from the highest administrative division, these are: Regions , Districts , Communities , and Health Facilities . In addition, Points of Entry represent places like harbors and airports where people are frequently entering the country, while Laboratories are technically health facilities that are specifically used for sample testing purposes. To import your data for one of these administrative divisions, log in as the default admin user and open the Configuration menu. Open any of the tabs for the infrastructure data you want to import and click on the Import button on the top right. You can download an import guide from within the popup window that will be opened, containing detailed instructions about the import process and the steps you need to go through in order to successfully import your data. Make sure that you always start with the highest administrative division when importing, i.e. regions, and work your way down to the lowest, because lower divisions typically contain references to higher divisions. Archive After importing your infrastructure data, you need to archive the default data unless you want it to appear in your app. To do that, again open the Configuration menu and the tab for the infrastructure data you want to archive. You can use the text filter on top of the screen to type in the name of the default data, then click on the edit icon to the right, and in the popup window that opens up, click on Archive and confirm your choice. After archiving the default infrastructure data, you might want to edit the default users and assign them to administrative divisions that you've imported. To do so, go to the User menu and click on the edit icon beneath the user you want to re-assign. Disease Configuration SORMAS supports a wide range of diseases, and not all of those might be relevant to any SORMAS instance or might be used in a different context. It is possible to adjust the following variables that define how the different diseases are handled: Whether the disease is active , i.e. it is used in this SORMAS instance Whether the disease is a primary disease, i.e. it is enabled for case surveillance; non-primary diseases can still be used for pathogen testing Whether the disease is case-based ; if not, it is only enabled for aggregate case reporting Whether contact follow-up is enabled The contact follow-up duration Right now, changing these variables unfortunately is not possible from within the user interface, but requires direct database access . If you have this access, you can edit the entries in the diseaseconfiguration table according to your needs. VERY IMPORTANT: Whenever you edit an entry in this table, you also need to manually set the changedate to the current date and time. This is required in order for the mobile app to synchronize the changes and use the edited disease configuration. Feature Configuration Some of the features in SORMAS can be enabled or disabled to further customize the system. Right now, changing these variables unfortunately is not possible from within the user interface, but requires direct database access . If you have this access, you can edit the entries in the featureconfiguration table. There is one entry for every configurable feature in this table, and you can set the value of the enabled column to true to enable it and false to disable it. The region , district , disease and enddate columns are currently only applicable for the line listing feature and define the scope in which line listing is used. Line listing is configurable from within the UI and does not need to be manually edited in the database. VERY IMPORTANT: Whenever you edit an entry in this table, you also need to manually set the changedate to the current date and time. This is required in order for the mobile app to synchronize the changes and use the edited feature configuration. The following features are currently configurable: Case Surveillance CASE_SURVEILANCE : The core module of SORMAS which allows the creation and management of suspect or confirmed disease cases. Contact Tracing CONTACT_TRACING : Management and follow-up of contacts of disease cases. Sample Management SAMPLES_LAB : Management of samples for cases, contacts or event participants and the documentation of pathogen tests performed on these samples. Event Surveillance EVENT_SURVEILLANCE : Creating and managing events and event participants to identify potential outbreaks or disease hotspots. Aggregate Reporting AGGREGATE_REPORTING : Allows collecting case numbers for a number of additional diseases for which case-based surveillance is not used. Commonly referred to as mSers in African countries. Weekly Reporting WEEKLY_REPORTING : Allows mobile users to confirm the number of cases they have collected on a weekly basis and web users to see an overview of whether or not mobile users have submitted their reports and how many cases they have reported. Clinical Management CLINICAL_MANAGEMENT : Enables the clinical management module of cases that allow collecting prescriptions and treatments as well as doctor's visits in a clinical context. National Case Sharing NATIONAL_CASE_SHARING : Allows users with the respective rights to make cases available to the whole country, i.e. other users will see these cases even if they don't belong to their jurisdiction. Task Generation (Case Surveillance) TASK_GENERATION_CASE_SURVEILLANCE : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks associated with case surveillance, especially the Case Investigation tasks that are usually generated when creating a new case. Task Generation (Contact Tracing) TASK_GENERATION_CONTACT_TRACING : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks associated with contact tracing, especially the Contact Investigation tasks that are usually generated when creating a new contact and the Contact Follow-Up tasks that are created once a day for every contact that is under follow-up. Task Generation (Event Surveillance) TASK_GENERATION_EVENT_SURVEILLANCE : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks associated with event surveillance. Task Generation (General) TASK_GENERATION_GENERAL : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks that aren't directly associated with one of the three other task types described above, e.g. the Weekly Report Generation task that asks mobile users to submit their weekly reports. Campaigns CAMPAIGNS : The campaigns module allows collecting flexible data which can be customized using the JSON format. Currently this is heavily geared towards vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan, but will be usable in a more generic way in the future for other countries as well. Area Infrastructure INFRASTRUCTURE_TYPE_AREA : Enables an additional infrastructure level above region that is called area by default. Currently only used in the campaigns module. Case Follow-Up CASE_FOLLOWUP : Enables the contact follow-up module for cases as well to allow a more detailed daily documentation of symptoms. Line Listing LINE_LISTING : Whether or not using line listing for case entry is enabled in the specified jurisdiction for the specified disease. Configurable from the UI, no database interaction needed. Documents DOCUMENTS : Enables document storage. GDPR Popup GDPR_CONSENT_POPUP : Enables a popup which informs new users about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union Task related notifications TASK_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables email and SMS notifications related to tasks management Notifications related to confirmed cases of event participants EVENT_PARTICIPANT_CASE_CONFIRMED_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables email and SMS notifications sent to surveillance officers of events when the case of an event participant is confirmed Other notifications OTHER_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables other email and SMS notifications (other than those impacted by TASK_NOTIFICATIONS and EVENT_PARTICIPANT_CASE_CONFIRMED_NOTIFICATIONS ) Event groups EVENT_GROUPS : Enables Event Groups management. Event groups modification notifications EVENT_GROUPS_MODIFICATION_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables Event Groups notifications fired when creating a new Event Group or when adding or removing an Event from an Event Group. Proxy Settings Some SORMAS integrations support proxy settings: * Patient diary interface * Geocoding * SORMAS 2 SORMAS The proxy can be configured through the following system properties which can be passed as JVM arguments to the server: * org.jboss.resteasy.jaxrs.client.proxy.host * org.jboss.resteasy.jaxrs.client.proxy.port * org.jboss.resteasy.jaxrs.client.proxy.scheme","title":"Custimization"},{"location":"SERVER_CUSTOMIZATION/#customizing-a-sormas-server","text":"","title":"Customizing a SORMAS Server"},{"location":"SERVER_CUSTOMIZATION/#content","text":"Customizing a SORMAS Server Content Server Configuration Custom login page Custom download files in about section Importing Infrastructure Data Import Archive Disease Configuration Feature Configuration Proxy Settings","title":"Content"},{"location":"SERVER_CUSTOMIZATION/#server-configuration","text":"After installing a SORMAS servers, you can customize various configurations that define how SORMAS operates and is set up.

Right now, changing these variables unfortunately is not possible from within the user interface, but requires direct database access . If you have this access, you can edit the entries in the featureconfiguration table. There is one entry for every configurable feature in this table, and you can set the value of the enabled column to true to enable it and false to disable it. The region , district , disease and enddate columns are currently only applicable for the line listing feature and define the scope in which line listing is used. Line listing is configurable from within the UI and does not need to be manually edited in the database. VERY IMPORTANT: Whenever you edit an entry in this table, you also need to manually set the changedate to the current date and time. This is required in order for the mobile app to synchronize the changes and use the edited feature configuration. The following features are currently configurable: Case Surveillance CASE_SURVEILANCE : The core module of SORMAS which allows the creation and management of suspect or confirmed disease cases. Contact Tracing CONTACT_TRACING : Management and follow-up of contacts of disease cases. Sample Management SAMPLES_LAB : Management of samples for cases, contacts or event participants and the documentation of pathogen tests performed on these samples. Event Surveillance EVENT_SURVEILLANCE : Creating and managing events and event participants to identify potential outbreaks or disease hotspots. Aggregate Reporting AGGREGATE_REPORTING : Allows collecting case numbers for a number of additional diseases for which case-based surveillance is not used. Commonly referred to as mSers in African countries. Weekly Reporting WEEKLY_REPORTING : Allows mobile users to confirm the number of cases they have collected on a weekly basis and web users to see an overview of whether or not mobile users have submitted their reports and how many cases they have reported. Clinical Management CLINICAL_MANAGEMENT : Enables the clinical management module of cases that allow collecting prescriptions and treatments as well as doctor's visits in a clinical context. National Case Sharing NATIONAL_CASE_SHARING : Allows users with the respective rights to make cases available to the whole country, i.e. other users will see these cases even if they don't belong to their jurisdiction. Task Generation (Case Surveillance) TASK_GENERATION_CASE_SURVEILLANCE : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks associated with case surveillance, especially the Case Investigation tasks that are usually generated when creating a new case. Task Generation (Contact Tracing) TASK_GENERATION_CONTACT_TRACING : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks associated with contact tracing, especially the Contact Investigation tasks that are usually generated when creating a new contact and the Contact Follow-Up tasks that are created once a day for every contact that is under follow-up. Task Generation (Event Surveillance) TASK_GENERATION_EVENT_SURVEILLANCE : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks associated with event surveillance. Task Generation (General) TASK_GENERATION_GENERAL : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks that aren't directly associated with one of the three other task types described above, e.g. the Weekly Report Generation task that asks mobile users to submit their weekly reports. Campaigns CAMPAIGNS : The campaigns module allows collecting flexible data which can be customized using the JSON format. Currently this is heavily geared towards vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan, but will be usable in a more generic way in the future for other countries as well. Area Infrastructure INFRASTRUCTURE_TYPE_AREA : Enables an additional infrastructure level above region that is called area by default. Currently only used in the campaigns module. Case Follow-Up CASE_FOLLOWUP : Enables the contact follow-up module for cases as well to allow a more detailed daily documentation of symptoms. Line Listing LINE_LISTING : Whether or not using line listing for case entry is enabled in the specified jurisdiction for the specified disease. Configurable from the UI, no database interaction needed. Documents DOCUMENTS : Enables document storage. GDPR Popup GDPR_CONSENT_POPUP : Enables a popup which informs new users about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union Task related notifications TASK_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables email and SMS notifications related to tasks management Notifications related to confirmed cases of event participants EVENT_PARTICIPANT_CASE_CONFIRMED_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables email and SMS notifications sent to surveillance officers of events when the case of an event participant is confirmed Other notifications OTHER_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables other email and SMS notifications (other than those impacted by TASK_NOTIFICATIONS and EVENT_PARTICIPANT_CASE_CONFIRMED_NOTIFICATIONS ) Event groups EVENT_GROUPS : Enables Event Groups management.

Manually create an admin user in Keycloak for the SORMAS realm Creating a user (username has to be the same as admin's username in SORMAS) 2. Login to SORMAS and trigger the Sync Users button from the Users page 3. This will sync users to Keycloak keeping their original password - see SORMAS Keycloak Service Provider for more information about this Keycloak configuration More about the default configuration and how to customize can be found here Keycloak Web Server Setup Apache Web Server Note: This is not necessary for development systems. When you are using SORMAS in a production environment you should use a http server like Apache 2 instead of putting the Payara server in the first line. Here are some things that you should do to configure the Apache server as a proxy: Activate all needed modules: a2enmod ssl a2enmod rewrite a2enmod proxy a2enmod proxy_http a2enmod headers Create a new site /etc/apache2/sites-available/your.sormas.server.url.conf (e.g. sormas.org.conf).

For SORMAS this is port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). In addition you will need the SSH port to access the server for admin purposes. We suggest to use UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) which provides a simple interface to iptables: sudo apt-get install ufw sudo ufw default deny incoming sudo ufw default allow outgoing sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw allow http sudo ufw allow https sudo ufw enable Postfix Mail Server Install postfix and mailutils apt install aptitude aptitude install postfix -> choose \"satelite system\" apt install mailutils Configure your system nano /etc/aliases -> add \"root: enter-your@support-email-here.com\" nano /opt/domains/sormas/config/logback.xml -> make sure \"EMAIL_ERROR\" appender is active and sends out to your email address Testing the Server Setup Use SSL Labs to test your server security config: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest R Software Environment In order to enable disease network diagrams in the contact dashboard, R and several extension packages are required. Then the Rscript executable has to be configured in the sormas.properties file. This can be conveniently accomplished by executing the R setup script from the SORMAS ZIP archive (see SORMAS Server ): If the SORMAS installation has been customized, r-setup.sh the install paths may have to be adjusted accordingly with a text editor. Execute R setup script and follow its instructions. chmod +x r-setup.sh ./r-setup.sh SORMAS to SORMAS Certificate Setup To be able to communicate with other SORMAS instances, there are some additional steps which need to be taken, in order to set up the certificate and the truststore. Please see the related guide for detailed instructions regarding SORMAS to SORMAS setup. Troubleshooting Problem: Login fails Check that the users table does have a corresponding entry. If not, the database initialization that is done when deploying sormas-ear.ear probably had an error. Problem: Server is out of memory Old servers were set up with a memory size of less than 2048MB. You can change this using the following commands: /opt/payara-172/glassfish/bin/asadmin --port 6048 delete-jvm-options -Xmx512m /opt/payara-172/glassfish/bin/asadmin --port 6048 delete-jvm-options -Xmx1024m /opt/payara-172/glassfish/bin/asadmin --port 6048 create-jvm-options -Xmx2048m Alternative: You can edit the settings directly in the domain.xml in the config directory of the SORMAS domain. Just search for Xmx - there should be two entries that need to be changed.","title":"Setup"},{"location":"SERVER_SETUP/#installing-a-sormas-server","text":"Note: This guide explains how to set up a SORMAS server on Linux and Windows systems, the latter only being intended for usage on development systems.

Answering all the questions asked in this guide will make sure that we will be able to integrate new diseases into SORMAS as quickly as possible. Content SOP for Adding New Diseases to SORMAS Content Guide Step 1: Download the Data Dictionary Step 2: Define Basic Disease Details Step 3: Define Existing Case Fields Step 4: Define Existing Person Fields Step 5: Define the Relevant Symptoms Step 6: Define the Relevant Epidemiological Data Step 7: Define Health Conditions Step 8: Define New Fields in Other Areas Step 9: Provide Case Classification Criteria Step 10: Provide Additional Information Step 11: Send Your Disease Definition to the SORMAS Team Guide Step 1: Download the Data Dictionary Download the latest Data Dictionary from this repository and open it. Please never use a version of the Data Dictionary that you downloaded earlier as it is very likely that its contents have changed in the meantime. You will use the Data Dictionary to define all the details of the new disease. Please make sure to mark every addition or change (e.g. by colorizing the text or background of the row in a subtle red) so we don't miss any of the information you have provided. Step 2: Define Basic Disease Details Open the Case tab of the Data Dictionary and scroll down to the tables that have a blue background. These tables define enumerations , which are basically data types with fixed values. Examples include the different case classifications, the gender of a person or the diseases that are used in SORMAS. Find the Disease enumeration table (refer to the Type column) and add a new row to it. Enter the following details: The name of the disease in the Caption column Optionally, if the disease has a long name, a short name or abbreviation in the Short column Use the Description column to answer the following question(s): Does the disease have contact follow-up ? If yes, for how many days should contact follow-up be done? Step 3: Define Existing Case Fields Look through the rows in the first table of the Case tab (which has a grey background). This table defines all the fields that are displayed in the Case Information tab in the SORMAS application. The Caption column defines the name of the field as it is displayed in the user interface, while the Diseases column specifies which diseases use this field. Please add the name (or, if available, short name) of your new disease to the \"New disease\" column of every row that represents a field that is relevant for it and colorize it. Step 4: Define Existing Person Fields Open the Person tab and repeat step 3 for the first table containing the fields that define the details of a person in SORMAS. Step 5: Define the Relevant Symptoms Open the Symptoms tab which lists all the symptoms that are currently used in SORMAS. This is a very long list and you will have to go through every single row and define whether this symptom should be tracked for your new disease or not. It's possible that your new disease uses one or more symptoms that are currently not part of SORMAS. In that case, you need to add a new row for each of these symptoms to the bottom of the table and provide the name of the symptom in the Caption column. Most symptoms in SORMAS are simple Yes/No/Unknown fields where Yes means that the symptom is present, No that the symptom is not present and Unknown that there is no information about whether the symptom is present or not. If your symptom can simply be defined by this pattern, you don't have to specify anything else. However, if your symptom is more complex (e.g. there are a number of pre-defined values that the user should choose from), please provide all the necessary details about how the symptom should be specified by users in the Description column. Step 6: Define the Relevant Epidemiological Data Open the Epidemiological data tab which lists all fields that are used to collect information about the epidemiological background of the case, e.g. whether they visited burials, had contact with a confirmed case or animals. Repeat step 3 for all rows in the first table, and add new rows if your new disease requires information that is not currently collected within SORMAS. As new fields in this tab are likely to be more complex than basic symptoms, make sure to define as much information about how they should function in the Description column. Step 7: Define Health Conditions Open the Health conditions tab which contains a list of pre-existing conditions that are not symptoms of the disease, but are still relevant especially for case management purposes in a hospital. Repeat step 3 for all rows in the first table, and add new rows if there are health conditions relevant for your new disease that are not part of SORMAS yet. As always with new fields, make sure to provide all relevant details in the Description column. Step 8: Define New Fields in Other Areas It is possible that your disease requires further information to be collected that is not supported by SORMAS yet, e.g. new details about the person, specific information about its hospitalization, or even very important fields that should directly go into the case information. You can use the same process you used to define new symptoms, health conditions or epidemiological data fields by opening the tab in question and adding new rows to the topmost table. At this point, you have finished all the necessary definitions in the Data Dictionary. Save your work and prepare an email with the Data Dictionary file attached to it. Don't send this email before working through the remaining steps though, as there are still a few details that are needed in order to finish the specification of your new disease. Step 9: Provide Case Classification Criteria Optimally, when defining a new disease, you should also specify the criteria SORMAS should use to automatically classify the case as suspect, probable or confirmed. In order to do this in a way that is compatible with the system we use, you will need access to a running SORMAS system (e.g. the play server you can find at https://sormas.org ). Log in as any user (e.g. the default user on the play server), open the About section from the main menu, and open the Case Classification Rules (HTML) document. Please define the classification criteria in a way that is similar to the system used in this document. If available, you can also send us an official document by WHO or your national CDC that specifies the classification criteria. Step 10: Provide Additional Information If there are still things that are necessary in order to properly implement the new disease in SORMAS (you might require us to create a whole new area for cases or there might be very complex mechanics that need a lot more specification), please give us as many details about them as possible. Just put all this information into your email. Step 11: Send Your Disease Definition to the SORMAS Team Send your email containing the updated Data Dictionary file, the case classification criteria and your additional notes to sormas@helmholtz-hzi.de. Congratulations, your work is done! We should now have all the information we need in order to integrate your disease into SORMAS. If there is anything that is unclear or if we need additional details, we will get in touch with you as soon as possible.

This is a very long list and you will have to go through every single row and define whether this symptom should be tracked for your new disease or not. It's possible that your new disease uses one or more symptoms that are currently not part of SORMAS. In that case, you need to add a new row for each of these symptoms to the bottom of the table and provide the name of the symptom in the Caption column. Most symptoms in SORMAS are simple Yes/No/Unknown fields where Yes means that the symptom is present, No that the symptom is not present and Unknown that there is no information about whether the symptom is present or not. If your symptom can simply be defined by this pattern, you don't have to specify anything else. However, if your symptom is more complex (e.g. there are a number of pre-defined values that the user should choose from), please provide all the necessary details about how the symptom should be specified by users in the Description column.","title":"Step 5: Define the Relevant Symptoms"},{"location":"SOP_DISEASES/#step-6-define-the-relevant-epidemiological-data","text":"Open the Epidemiological data tab which lists all fields that are used to collect information about the epidemiological background of the case, e.g. whether they visited burials, had contact with a confirmed case or animals. Repeat step 3 for all rows in the first table, and add new rows if your new disease requires information that is not currently collected within SORMAS.
